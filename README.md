# myBudgetApp
[C++] Small text-based app to track a personal budget. 

[Part 1]
The purpose of this project is to create a simple user interface for interacting with a program. The program will provide a basic menu that will allow the user to input a number to execute some specific actions, each of which you will implement.

[Part 2]
The purpose of this project is to begin to introduce some simple domain objects, using Structs into our budget application: Budget, Account, and Envelope. In addition, we will use Enumerations to help to clean up our Menu code.

[Part 3]
The purpose of this project is to transition our simple domain in our budget application: Budget, Account, and Envelope, to classes.

[Part 4]
The purpose of this project is to begin to make use of inheritance in our budget application by encapsulating deposit and withdrawal functionality into a base class named BudgetItem, and beginning to create an inheritance hierarchy to leverage and refine this behavior, starting with the Account class.

[Part 5]
The purpose of this project is to complete the transition from imperative program to object oriented program, and add additional polymorphic behavior to a new class, BudgetEnvelope.

[Part 6]
The purpose of this project is to implement a template Tree class that will be able to hold instances of our BudgetEnvelope. Change the given Tree implementation to allow multiple types to be stored in the Nodes.
